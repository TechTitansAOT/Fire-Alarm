# Fire-Alarm
We developed an IoT-based Automated Fire Detection and Notification System to enhance safety by detecting fire hazards in real-time and sending instant notifications. The system uses an IR fire sensor to detect fire and an ESP8266 module for communication. We've also integrated the Blynk app to monitor the system's status on our mobile devices.
